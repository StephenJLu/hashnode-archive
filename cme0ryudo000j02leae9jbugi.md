> “If we’re starting with the wrong questions, if we don’t understand the cause, then even the right answers will always steer us wrong…eventually. The truth, you see, is always revealed…eventually.”

—Simon Sinek, *Start with Why*

## Orienteering

It begins with two essential tools: a map and a compass. Participants start at a designated point and navigate through a series of control points marked on the map. The challenge lies in choosing the most efficient route between these points while dealing with the physical and environmental obstacles along the way. If a participant encounters a physical barrier like a dense thicket, a stream, or a steep incline, they must recheck their position on the map, adjust their bearing with the compass, and find an alternate route to continue forward safely. This process repeats until the participant reaches the final destination, marked as the finish point on the map.

In the Boy Scouts, orienteering was both a physical and mental challenge—a rigorous test of fitness, navigation skills, and strategic thinking. We began our journey at a specific starting point, equipped with our maps and compasses, and embarked on a trek through the rugged Catalina Mountains. Our goal was to reach our campsite, hidden deep within the wilderness. Accurate navigation was crucial; if we missed our mark, we would find ourselves sleeping under the stars without a tent. Don’t worry, we had safety measures: we carried two-way radios and backup GPS devices for emergencies.

In the merit badge guide, the first requirement isn’t to explain what orienteering is.

The very first requirement follows:

Show that you know first aid for the types of injuries that could occur while orienteering, including cuts, scratches, blisters, snakebite, insect stings, tick bites, heat and cold reactions (sunburn, heatstroke, heat exhaustion, hypothermia), and dehydration. Explain to your counselor why you should be able to identify poisonous plants and poisonous animals that are found in your area.

(from *Merit Badge Series: Orienteering*, Boy Scouts of America)

In order to master orienteering, you must understand how to perform first aid for any physical injuries or risks that you might encounter along the way. This is a crucial skill because orienteering often takes you through remote and rugged terrain where professional medical help may not be immediately accessible.

Equally important is the ability to stay calm and make rational decisions in stressful situations. This includes assessing the severity of an injury, determining whether it's safe to continue or if you need to signal for help, and knowing how to communicate your location effectively if an evacuation is necessary.

Additionally, being trained in first aid can enhance your confidence and peace of mind, allowing you to focus more on navigation and less on the potential dangers. This mental preparedness is a key aspect of mastering orienteering, as it enables you to stay composed and act decisively when facing unexpected challenges.

## Getting Clear on Your Vision

To prepare yourself for a career in forensics or forensic leadership, the first and most essential step is to get clear on your own purpose and vision. Ideally (and usually), your personal vision will align with the vision of the organization that you work for.

With a clear vision, you will have a sense of direction that will help you set personal short- and long-term goals. Being clear on this helps you understand where your passion lies and what work you are committed to performing. You will also be more resilient against any assault or injury to your vision from external pressures. Forensic science can be challenging and demanding, so a strong sense of purpose can act as a compass *and* as “first aid,” helping you to stay motivated and aligned to your goals and remaining resilient against these assaults.

Forensic scientists play a critical role in the criminal justice system. A clear sense of your vision and purpose that is rooted in a commitment to fair justice ensures that you remain dedicated to ethical practices, minimizing conscious or unconscious biases as much as possible in your pursuit of the truth.

Even if you are not aspiring to act as an authority figure in your field, having a clear vision allows you to act as a leader in your own life and career. Being steadfast in your purpose can align your career with your personal values and interests, which fosters greater job satisfaction and fulfillment. When your work is meaningful to you, it enhances your engagement and overall well-being and happiness.

## Somerset and Mills

In the movie, *Se7en*, two detectives, William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and David Mills (Brad Pitt), investigate a series of brutal murders that appear to revolve around a theme of the seven deadly sins. Although not explicitly listed in the Bible, in 590 AD, Pope Gregory I enumerated seven transgressions that are fatal to spiritual progress and they became a central tenet in Roman Catholic theology.[\[1\]](#_ftn1) It’s important to note that while everyone may experience all of these to some degree, the seven deadly sins relate to the extreme, habitual, and drastic adherence to these qualities. 

1. Pride (Hubris/arrogance leading to disdain or disregard for others)
    
2. Avarice (Insatiable material greed)
    
3. Lust (Uncontrolled desires or cravings)
    
4. Wrath (Intense rage or hatred)
    
5. Gluttony (Excessive consumption of food and drink, insatiable appetite)
    
6. Envy (Resentment caused by another’s possessions, character, or achievements)
    
7. Sloth (Habitual and extreme disinclination to work or exertion)
    

Each victim in the movie was chosen because in some fashion—as deemed by the perpetrator, John Doe—they embodied one of the deadly sins. He meticulously planned and executed these murders to expose the moral decay he perceived in society.

As the detectives delved deeper into each case, they faced not only the horrors of the crimes but also the darker aspects of their own characters and lives. Somerset was a weary veteran detective on the brink of retirement. He grappled with his own sense of disillusionment and cynicism about humanity. Mills, younger and more impulsive, struggled with his anger and intense desire for justice.

***Spoiler Alert***

*The next two paragraphs contain spoilers for the movie,* Se7en*. Please skip to the next section (after asterisks) if you still want to watch the movie and enjoy the surprise.*

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

The climax of the film reveals a harrowing twist: John Doe’s (Kevin Spacey) final murders implicated the detectives themselves in the clutches of sin. He orchestrates the murder of Mills’ wife (that famous box) as a representation of his own envy and goads Mills to embody wrath by killing Doe in an intensely emotional fit of vengeance. This act completes the series, demonstrating how the sins that Doe vied to punish exist within everyone, even those who worked to uphold and exact fair justice.

The underlying theme of finding sins within oneself is emphasized by the journey of the detectives as they confront their own moral vulnerabilities. Somerset’s recognition of his own apathy and Mills’ ultimate capitulation to wrath reveal the pervasive nature of sin and the complexity of human morality. *Se7en* may be suggesting that the potential for these sins lies within everyone, challenging the notion of a purely legalistic view of clear-cut good and evil.

## Seven “Deadly” Visions in Forensics

Although not as blatantly defined as the seven deadly sins or outright criminal acts, this author believes that there are seven types of visions that are “deadly” to a profession in forensic science and forensic leadership (or broadly, public service). While these visions may not be consciously at the forefront of your personal vision, you should take care to ensure that these aspects are not unwittingly buried in the undercurrents of your own purpose.

**1\. Control**

When one’s vision is to attain a position in which they can control people, it leads to excessive micromanagement and strong feelings of resentment when they find it’s not possible.

More abstractly, in the United States, we live in a capitalist society, wherein the freedoms of choice (competition) and monetary transactions (private property) are foundational tenets. Even in government, the freedom to vote for a representative of the people is at the core of a democratic republic.

To elevate a person whose ultimate goal is to control people will ultimately lead to a semblance of totalitarianism.

**2\. Perfectionism**

We are human. Perfection is an unrealistic and unattainable standard.

When mistakes are viewed as fire-able offenses or reasons to treat someone as less than, innovation, learning, and forward-moving development of the workforce are stifled.

Perfectionism can also lead to catastrophizing, where one retains a mindset in which they believe that mistakes will lead to the downfall of their career or to the laboratory. Having this mindset might lead to debilitating restriction of yourself, or worse—if in a forensic leader—of the laboratory culture. It’s an “I don’t want to make any mistakes, so I’m not going to do that work” mentality. Mistakes will not lead to the end of your career, nor to total laboratory failure. If that were true, no one would have a job and there wouldn’t be any forensic laboratories in service. However, what *will* be a treacherous road to travel is attempting to cover up mistakes or imperfections in order to attain an outward image of perfection.

When mistakes happen, own up to them, take accountability, and change your behavior or procedures. Don’t allow them to become a pattern of behavior.

**3\. Money**

Money itself is not bad; it is an incredible vehicle for action, living, and society. As opposed to bartering, a monetary system ensures a standardized medium of exchange, liquidity, scalable economics, and global trade.

The strive towards riches purely for the sake of riches, however, can be deadly to a profession in public service. The pure striving for riches can be a very short walk to unethical decisions, which are not only catastrophic for an individual in forensics but can also lead to fundamental laboratory failure.

**4\. Legalism/Self-Righteousness**

Unlike David Mills in *Se7en*, forensic practitioners cannot act as the judge, jury, and executioner in the cases they examine. Regardless of your personal biases or opinions, the work you do is only one piece of a greater whole—but it is a significant piece and can significantly affect the lives and livelihoods of the people involved. In every single case.

Regardless of the severity of a case, you must allow the criminal justice system to work as it was intended: cases are brought before a judge and jury, who will ultimately decide—based on argument and evidence—if a conviction is justified, and what punishment is appropriate according to the established penal codes.

Who are you, as an individual, to decide if someone is guilty of a crime because of the work you’ve done on a particular case?

**5\. Coercive Power & Rank/Status**

Like money, power and rank itself is not a bad thing. It’s when one wants to gain power and rank in order to control others through coercion that it becomes a problem and a “deadly” vision.

The bases of power are as follows:

1. Referent Power - Based on how much a person is liked and respected
    
2. Expert Power - Based on a person’s perceived knowledge about a certain subject. You have expert power in the courtroom.
    
3. Legitimate Power - Derived from a formal position held in an organization’s hierarchy
    
4. Reward Power - Based on one’s ability to give a reward as a means to influence others (aka the “carrot”)
    
5. Coercive Power - Ability to force others to follow an order by threatening punishment (aka the “stick”)
    

Certainly, there are situations where coercive power is required. By and large, however, most civilian professional companies and organizations will not require the use of coercive power. If it is used, one should take care to ensure that it is truly justified. If coercive power is overused or used without justification, it can drastically erode trust and respect between leaders and employees.

Forensic practitioners are generally civilian professionals. We're not at war or engaged in active policing or law enforcement. The work we do is to assist with criminal and civil investigations through the principles of science. Forensic leaders should strive to foster that sentiment throughout the industry.

Some mottos of a few forensic professional associations can provide a guideline:

**California Association of Criminalists**: *fiat justitia per scientiam* - “Let justice be done through science (knowledge)”

**California Association of Crime Laboratory Directors**: “Advancing Forensic Science Through Effective Management”

**The American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors**: “Excellence in Forensic Science Management through Leadership and Innovation” 

**6\. Fame-Seeking**

This author will be blunt: when one enters forensics seeking to become famous, they are feeding a delusion that has no basis in reality. The investigation and prosecution of criminal cases take a great number of people and teams in order to execute properly and fairly.

If someone readily dismisses or disregards routine cases as “needless” or chooses to cherry-pick only high-profile cases to concentrate on, that is an immense and destructive disservice to the public and profession.

Sheltri Gresham, former president of the California Association of Criminalists, wrote an excellent and informed feature on how the work of the forensic scientist is simply one part of a greater whole.[\[2\]](#_ftn2)

**7\. Anything Discriminatory**

This is illegal.

**Calibrate Your Compass**

To sum up, while the concept of the seven deadly sins may traditionally be associated with morality or criminal behavior, this author argues that there are seven types of visions equally destructive to the professions of forensic science and forensic leadership, or more broadly, to public service.

These visions, including control, perfectionism, the pursuit of money, legalism/self-righteousness, coercive power and rank/status, fame-seeking, and any form of discrimination, if left unchecked, can corrode the integrity and effectiveness of the American criminal justice system. True, it’s not perfect and perceived injustices can still occur; however, practitioners can try to minimize these occurrences by adopting the correct mindset and working to maintain integrity.

To do so, it is imperative for professionals who work in these domains to vigilantly guard against these tendencies, to ensure that their actions and motivations align with the principles of justice, integrity, and service to society. By recognizing and addressing these "deadly” visions, we can contribute to the advancement and ethical practice of forensic science and public service for the betterment of society as a whole.

## Countering the Seven “Deadly” Visions in Forensics

Self-inquiry and fundamental, life-altering mindset changes such as these are difficult and take time. Practically, you might not be able to address every single maladaptive aspect of vision in your own career. What you can do, however, is to start small:

Take 15 minutes once a day/week/month to write out what you think your passions and strengths are (or maybe areas you want to improve).

Then, write a few small practical steps that would help you work towards that vision in your life or in your work. Take care that these steps do not depend on other people to accomplish.

Keep your list close and make a consistent mental note of your progress. It will help you reset your thinking in times of uncertainty or challenge.

It can help to evaluate if there are already any systems in place that you can contribute towards. Or, if you see a gap in the currently available systems, is there anything you can do to improve that system? Can you establish a *new* system at your laboratory that will help you and your teams to reach and sustain a certain objective?

## Lifting the Self vs. Service to the Team or Community

When looking at the seven “deadly” visions—control of others, perfectionism, pursuit of money, legalism/self-righteousness, coercive power & rank/status, fame-seeking, and discrimination—a theme of *lifting the self* over others becomes apparent. It makes sense, then, that the counters to these maladaptive visions generally focus on *service to the team or community*. Ideally, this is what forensics and forensic leadership are all about.

To directly counter the seven “deadly” visions, this author believes the following visions are appropriate for a career in forensics and forensic leadership.

**1\. Positive Influence *(Counters Control)***

Fostering positive influence on others revolves around inspiring and encouraging them to grow and succeed through support, guidance, and example. The focus is on building trust, demonstrating empathy with healthy boundaries, and offering constructive and honest feedback that empowers individuals to make their own decisions and to do their best work. Attempting to control other people is characterized by imposing your own will, manipulating, lying, and dictating others’ actions and behaviors, which often leads to resentment and unhealthy dependency.

Controlling others might yield short-term compliance, but in the long term, it stifles creativity, innovation, and kills trust. Ultimately, striving to control other people will force your best workers and independent thinkers out the door.

The following statements are ***bad*** examples of vision statements. They invite control of others.

> “I’ve worked hard to get here, so I know what needs to be done. My job is to tell them how to do it.”

> “Now that I’m a leader, my direct reports have to do what I say.”

The following statements are ***better*** examples of vision statements. They foster positive influence.

> “I want to lead by example, where my employees feel supported and included. That will motivate them to do their best work.”

> “I’ve worked hard to get this job. Now, I can guide others so that they can set the example.”

**2\. Confidence and Trust in Your Work *(Counters Perfectionism)***

Perfectionism is an unhealthy obsession with the self, with little regard to the purpose of one’s work. In this obsession, it’s easy to get mired in the process and forget why you’re doing the work in the first place.

As a forensic scientist, countering perfectionism is essential to maintaining a balanced and effective approach to your work. Having a healthy confidence in your own expertise and work is crucial, and it should be complemented by a trust in the comprehensive technical and administrative review processes that are in place. These layers of scrutiny ensure that any errors or egregious mistakes can be identified and corrected, enhancing the overall reliability of your findings.

Furthermore, the rigorous validation of laboratory procedures serves as a cornerstone for quality assurance, providing a tested framework that minimizes the risk of errors. Laboratory accreditation also plays an important role, as it signifies adherence to quality standards and best practices, bolstering the credibility of your work in court.

With these structured supports in place, you can mitigate the pressures of perfectionism, relying on the combined strength of your expertise and these institutional safeguards. They minimize risk and uphold the integrity of your work.

The following statements are ***bad*** examples of vision statements. They invite perfectionism.

> “There’s always someone worse. My job is to be better than them.”

> “I’m only going to do the minimal amount of work needed on this case. The more I do, the more chances I’ll have to make a mistake.”

> “I can’t say anything wrong in court. That’ll end my career as a forensic scientist.”

The following statements are ***better*** examples of vision statements. They foster confidence in your own work.

> “I want to be excellent at my job by improving my skills and knowledge, setting personal benchmarks for growth, and working towards a collaborative setting. I’ll make mistakes along the way, but I don’t have to fear them. I can learn from them.”

> “I need to approach every case with thoughtfulness and intentionality. I understand that quality work and attention to detail are essential in every case. With the review process, I’m minimizing risks, and I know I can rely on the accuracy and reliability of my findings.”

> “If I think I misspoke during court, I can always clarify my responses in a clear, calm, and accountable manner. It’s better to speak up about my mistakes than to try to hide them.”

**3\. Service *(Counters Money)***

Shifting the focus from the pure pursuit of money to service to the community can profoundly transform the purpose and impact of your work. While money is undoubtedly a valuable tool that provides monetary incentive, enables action, and facilitates your efforts, it should not be the sole driving force behind your endeavors.

By prioritizing service to the laboratory or community, you can align your goals with the greater good, fostering a sense of fulfillment and purpose that transcends financial gain. This shift can encourage you to use your skills and resources to address perceived laboratory and community needs, promote well-being, and create long-lasting positive change. When your work is grounded in a commitment to serve others, it can help build stronger, more resilient teams. You will derive a deeper sense of satisfaction and meaning from your contributions.

Ultimately, focusing on service cultivates a more equitable and compassionate work environment, where success is measured not just by financial metrics but by the positive difference we make in the lives of those around us.

The following statements are ***bad*** examples of vision statements. They invite focus purely on money.

> “I want to become a supervisor because it pays me much better.”

> “I need to move up in my career if I want to get that house/car/boat. I deserve it after all the hard work I’ve done.”

The following statements are ***better*** examples of vision statements. They foster a sense of service.

> “I want to become a supervisor to lead and inspire my team. Fostering mentorship and team development will ultimately lead to the long-term success and well-being of this laboratory.”

> “I want to move up in my career to expand my impact and influence. I’ll face new challenges and develop my leadership skills even further. I can make a difference in forensics and become a positive role model for others who want to lead.”

**4\. Objective Examination *(Counters Legalism/Self-Righteousness)***

Countering confirmation bias in forensics is critical to providing impartial and accurate testimony. One effective strategy is fostering a culture of critical thinking and continuous peer review—a standard in forensic work—where forensic examiners are constantly questioning the evidence and considering possible alternative hypotheses. Evaluate, “What is the *evidence* saying?” rather than, “What do *I* think the evidence is telling me?”

Specifically, addressing legalism involves challenging the rigid adherence to procedural or moral norms that may overshadow the pursuit of truth. Encouraging forensic experts to view cases with an objective perspective and to truthfully evaluate their own methodologies can mitigate this bias.

Furthermore, countering self-righteousness requires instilling a sense of humility and openness to feedback. This can be achieved through regular training sessions that emphasize the fallibility of human judgment and susceptibility to bias in forensic practitioners. The importance of collaborative efforts in reaching unbiased conclusions in forensics cannot be overstated. By promoting these practices, forensic practitioners can better navigate the complexities of their work without falling prey to confirmation bias.

The following statements are ***bad*** examples of vision statements. They invite bias.

> "My job is to help the prosecution win cases."

> "I have to do what the detectives say because I’m trying to help them find the bad guy."

> "I just found the suspect on this evidence. He’s so screwed!"

> "I'm working for law enforcement."

The following statements are ***better*** examples of vision statements. They foster objectivity.

> “I want to provide valid, timely, and accurate forensic services.”

> “I am providing an objective voice to the evidence.”

> “I am an independent analyst who uses science to assist with criminal and civil investigations.”

> “The work I do directly influences the criminal justice system and public safety.”

**5\. Expert, Legitimate, and Referent Power *(Counters Coercive Power & Rank/Status)***

When one thinks of the word *power*, this author believes that *coercive power* is generally what comes to mind. This mindset can be detrimental in leadership because coercive power is “power over”, rather than “power with”.

When someone rises in rank, and they believe that coercive power is the only path forward, they will rely on threats and punishment as a means to control others and protect their authority. This will ultimately breed fear, resentment, and an utter lack of genuine trust and respect between team members and leaders. This type of power undermines creativity, innovation, and motivation, which can lead to a toxic work environment and high turnover rates.

Instead, effective leaders understand that there are different forms of power, and should focus on cultivating expert, legitimate, and referent power. In the long term, these forms of power are much more sustainable and foster healthy organizational integrity.

**Expert power** is derived from a leader’s knowledge and skills, earning respect and admiration through competence and expertise.

**Legitimate power** comes from a leader’s formal position or role, which should be used to guide and support rather than control.

**Referent power** is based on the personal qualities of a leader, such as integrity, empathy, and charisma, which inspire loyalty and admiration.

By building these influential forms of power, forensic leaders can create a positive, collaborative, and productive environment that fosters growth and innovation.

The following statements are ***bad*** examples of vision statements. They invite temptation to use coercive power.

> “As long as my direct reports are productive and competent, I’m doing a good job.”

> “If my direct reports question my orders, I need to discipline them harshly. No one questions me.”

The following statements are ***better*** examples of vision statements. They foster more positive forms of power.

> “I want to become a leading authority in forensic DNA analysis by continually advancing my expertise, embracing innovation, and helping my team provide quality forensic services rooted in objectivity and trust.”  
> Expert Power

> "My vision is to create a workplace culture that inspires and empowers every individual through integrity, empathy, and shared values, building a forensic team where respect and admiration are the foundations of our success."  
> Referent Power

> "My vision as lab director is to establish ourselves as the most trusted and reliable partner in the city/county/state, grounded in our commitment to excellent service, ethical leadership, and unwavering support for our stakeholders and community."  
> Legitimate Power

**6\. Teamwork & Mentoring *(Counters Fame-Seeking)***

Fostering teamwork and mentoring in forensic leadership is vital for ensuring comprehensive and accurate investigations. Unlike fame-seeking, which prioritizes unhealthy individual recognition over the team, a collaborative approach acknowledges that forensic work is just one crucial component of a larger investigative process. While recognizing individual achievement is important, it should not be the primary motivation behind forensic examination.

By emphasizing teamwork, forensic leaders can ensure healthy coordination between different forensic experts, law enforcement, the criminal justice community, and other stakeholders (such as the public), leading to more thorough, accurate, and reliable outcomes and information. This coordination can result in enhanced public safety and greater trust between the public and law enforcement.

Mentoring within this context helps to develop a strong foundation of skills and knowledge, ensuring that all team members are well-equipped to handle complex cases. This collaborative spirit not only enhances the quality of forensic work but also fosters a culture of continuous improvement and professional development. Team members will be happier, more engaged, and motivated to perform their best work.

Prioritizing these values over personal acclaim ensures that the ultimate goal of forensics—pursuing the truth and communicating results effectively—is achieved ethically through collective effort and shared expertise.

The following statements are ***bad*** examples of vision statements. They invite self-aggrandizing and fame-seeking.

> “I’ve managed a team of forensic biologists on a successful research project; that means I’m a good research scientist.”

> “I’m only going to do my best work on high-profile cases. That will increase my chances of career success and noteworthiness.”

The following statements are ***better*** examples of vision statements. They foster teamwork and collaboration.

> “I’ve managed a team of forensic biologists on a successful research project. As their leader, I’m glad I was able to help them put their best foot forward and addressed any obstacles in the way forward for the team.”

> "Every case I work, regardless of its publicity, deserves intentional effort and accuracy. My career success in forensics comes from consistently delivering quality work, building a reputation for reliability and thoroughness."

**7\. Inclusion *(Counters Discrimination)***

Discrimination at a forensic laboratory (or any workplace) fundamentally violates ethical principles, undermining the integrity and fairness that are the cornerstones of forensic science. Tolerating discrimination compromises the objectivity and reliability of forensic analyses coming out of a lab, as it demonstrates active biases and prejudices which can influence the interpretation and presentation of evidence.

This not only jeopardizes the accuracy and prosecution of criminal cases but also erodes fundamental public trust in the justice system.

Fostering authentic identity and inclusion, on the other hand, ensures a broad range of perspectives and experiences, which enhances problem-solving and innovation. Inclusive practices promote a culture of respect and equity, where all team members feel valued and empowered to contribute their best work. By embracing diversity, forensic laboratories can uphold ethical standards, thereby improving the quality of their work, and better serving the pursuit of justice.

The following statements are ***bad*** examples of a vision statements. They invite discrimination.

These examples refer to disability, but the main point can apply to various forms of inclusion, such as sex, race, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, and so on.

Put simply, inclusion is the acknowledgement of being human.

> “I don’t want to hire anyone with disabilities. They cost more and I have to do more paperwork, plus it’s not a good look for the lab.”

> “If I have to provide accommodations for one person, I’ll have to start providing accommodations for everyone. They’re probably just being lazy, anyway.”

The following statements are ***better*** examples of vision statements. They foster inclusion.

> “People with disabilities are human just like me. While accommodations might incur some costs and paperwork, they are minimal compared to the long-term benefits of creating an inclusive and innovative team.”

> “I can provide accommodations for this person. I’m trying to create an equitable work environment to help my employees do their job. It’s not about preferential treatment, and I don’t really know what he’s going through in life. My job is to help him perform at his best while he’s here.”

## Putting It All Together

Orienting your vision as a forensic practitioner or forensic leader is probably one of the most fundamental and essential steps to practice. Even if you’re already a lab director or close to retirement, it’s never too late to take a closer look at your vision and adjust your course.

The author hopes that this article has helped you gain some insights into visions that can be detrimental to a career in public service and visions that will help orient you on a prosperous journey in public service.
