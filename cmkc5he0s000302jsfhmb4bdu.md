We did not ask for this room,  
or this music;  
we were invited in.  
Therefore,  
because the dark surrounds us,  
let us turn our faces toward the light.  
Let us endure hardship  
to be grateful for plenty.  
We have been given pain  
to be astounded by joy.  
We have been given life  
to deny death.  
We did not ask for this room,  
or this music.  
But because we are here,  
let us dance.
