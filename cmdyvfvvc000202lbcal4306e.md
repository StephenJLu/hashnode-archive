> In this article, I share my personal journey of learning American Sign Language (ASL) from a young age, highlighting the shift from auditory to visual communication due to hearing loss and voicelessness. I provide an overview of useful resources for learning ASL, both online and in-person, including structured classes, self-paced tools, and comprehensive dictionaries. This compilation serves as a guide for anyone looking to start or continue their ASL learning experience, offering practical advice and recommendations for various learning styles.

## My ASL Journey

Growing up, I got interested in learning ASL and I purchased a book. Back then, I learned the alphabet and a few basic signs, but not much else. Fast forward to today, living with hearing loss and the complete loss of my voice, becoming fluent in ASL has become a much more urgent need for communication and socializing. Throughout my ASL learning experience, I have used a number of resources to learn this difficult language. An essential part of the mindset shift is transitioning from an oral, auditory language to a visual one.

Below are a few of the resources that are available out there. It's not an all-encompassing list, but maybe it'll be enough to get you started.

If you live in San Diego or Orange County, Language Door offers in-person and virtual classes for beginning ASL. I thrive better in structured classes, so these classes were a good jumpstart.

## ASL Pinnacle - Jason Gervase

Jason founded ASL Pinnacle to provide ASL learning in a supportive environment. He also provides tutoring sessions and workshops with specific concept focus to expand on the lessons. In addition, Jason posts a bunch of free content revolving around ASL concepts on Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok.

## Lifeprint.com/ASLU - Dr. Bill Vicars

If self-learning and instruction are more your speed, Dr. Bill Vicars hosts and posts a ton of free content on his website and on YouTube, as part of his ASL University program. He has massive experience and knowledge in ASL education and in the expression and advocacy of Deaf culture.

## Lingvano

Continuing the self-paced learning structure, Lingvano provides a convenient learning experience on the web and phone apps. You can start with a few lessons for free, then pay for more advanced learning. These are small, bite-sized lessons that can be done in 10-15 minutes per day. I've found that everyday practice will increase your retention and fluency dramatically. Lingvano also provides the option to view yourself signing the lessons and dialogue. I highly recommend that you not only watch and learn, but you also sign everything yourself. Fluency begins by doing it yourself, making mistakes, and learning from them.

## Bob Rumball Foundation for the Deaf

In addition to a wide range of ASL courses (virtual and in-person), Bob Rumball provides numerous services for the Deaf community. They provide the only long term care facility in Canada for the Deaf, Deaf camp for children, and a plethora of other services from infants to adults and seniors.
