Back in 2024, I created this presentation as part of the Forensic Leaders Training Center®. In a few professional groups I am a part of today, we have been discussing the ADA and other employment law issues. To share what I had learned, I revived this presentation from my archives. You can find the full presentation below, along with some PDF resources about employment law underneath.
